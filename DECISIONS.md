# DECISIONS

Why X over Y. Dated, append-only.

## D1 — Network tap is the source of truth; DOM is for navigation only
2026-08-07. Data fields come only from captured Voyager / `salesApi*` response bodies, never
from parsed HTML. DOM reads are for click targets, pagination state, challenge detection, and
render confirmation only. See `docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D2 — Raw-first storage
2026-08-07. Every capture archives the untouched response body before any parsing; a wrong
parser is fixed by re-parsing history, never by re-scraping. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D3 — Receipt on stdout, data in the store
2026-08-07. Capability stdout is a fixed-size envelope regardless of result size; bulk data
goes to Supabase and the run archive. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D4 — Agent reads bulk data straight from Supabase
2026-08-07. No read-command wrapper layer; the agent runs SQL directly. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D5 — Structured NDJSON logs plus bounded query capabilities
2026-08-07. Logs are machine-readable event streams; the agent calls bounded query
capabilities instead of reading whole log files. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D6 — `HALT_AND_NOTIFY` exits non-zero and stops
2026-08-07. No desktop notification, no Slack, no file drop — the agent surfaces the non-zero
exit and receipt to the operator and does not proceed. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D7 — Playwright is not used against the production account
2026-08-07. Raw CDP only on the tab driving the real account; Playwright's `connectOverCDP`
enables an attach surface this design deliberately avoids. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D8 — Minimal CDP attach surface
2026-08-07. Enable `Network` only — never `Runtime.enable` (the `consoleAPICalled` detection
leak) or `Page.enable` (unneeded). See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D9 — Dedicated Chrome profile launched with `--remote-debugging-port`
2026-08-07. Automation Chrome runs on its own profile and port 9223, launched by the toolkit,
never attached via `chrome://inspect`; discovery goes through `GET /json/version`. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D10 — One resident worker tab, navigated between targets
2026-08-07. A single background-created tab is reused and navigated between targets for the
whole session, closed at session end. See
`docs/specs/2026-08-07-linkedin-toolkit-l0-l2-design.md`.

## D11 — The budget ledger is file-backed, never database-backed
2026-08-07. The ledger is the safety mechanism that protects a single unburnable
account. It must work when Supabase is down, when Docker is not running, and
before storage exists at all. It lives at `runs/budget.ndjson`, append-only.
Rejected: the `budget_ledger` Supabase table as the source of truth — a safety
check that depends on an external service can fail open, which is the one failure
mode that is unacceptable here. The table may later mirror the file for reporting.
